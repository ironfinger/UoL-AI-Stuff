Social a d environmental imapct:

Colours of the seasons will help benifit the natura and urban{} world. This is due to using natural dyes in hope of creating less pollution{}, therefore reducing the need for artificial dyes. As well as giving the consumer a more aesthetically pleasing item of clothing.


I carried out primary research by creating a survey and posting it to my social media accounts. Within the survey I made sure to find out what type of people target audience were. I found out the most important things they look for when purchasing clothes, asked whether they have used resale sites like depop. As well as including additional questions like, 'how often do you use online clothing sites?', 'Which of the sites would you use for online shopping?' and 'How of do you use online clothing sites?'. The main take away of my research is that 64.7% of people stated that the most important for them was aesthetic.

A potential unintendeed consequence is less clothes could be produced. This could be due to the fact that people may end up re-dyeing their clothes each season to save money on new clothes, especially as natural dyes fade over time. I believe this would be a postive aspect of the project because it reeduces the damage caused by fast fashion, as consumers may be encouraged to re-dye their clothes to adhere to the ever changing trends of each season.

I have explored the viability of Colours of the Seasons by exploring other solutions to satisfy requirements set by the breif. Some ideas have explored to match biomimicry were: Sewing lessons and kits, as nature is responsive and builds using abundant resources. Dontating clothing back to shops to recycle or resale, nature recycles all materials. The creation of more mushroom farms, nature builds using abundant resources.
